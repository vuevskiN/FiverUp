# FiverUp
To run the Project: you will need a google-service.json and a new firebase_options. connect the app with your firebase account and run flutterfire config.
I have added the emails mila.dodevska@finki.ukim.mk and petre.lameski@finki.ukim.mk to have admin roles in the project so they have access.
